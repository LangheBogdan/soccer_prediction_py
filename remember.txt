COMPLETED
✓ Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Infrastructure
✓ Phase 2: Database Schema Design & SQLAlchemy ORM (10 entities, 14 passing tests)
✓ Phase 2 (Continuation): Web Scraper & API Clients Implementation (80 passing tests)

COMPLETED IN PHASE 2 CONTINUATION - Web Scraper Implementation

1. ✓ **fbref.com Scraper** (src/scraper/fbref_scraper.py)
   - Extract league standings and team statistics
   - Extract historical match data with detailed stats
   - Rate limiting enforcement (2-second delays)
   - Error handling for missing data and network issues
   - Data transformation to match database schema
   - 21 comprehensive unit tests

2. ✓ **External API Clients** (src/clients/)
   - ✓ football-data.org client (src/clients/football_data_client.py)
     - Fetch current matches for a league with status filters
     - Fetch standings for 6 major European leagues
     - Fetch betting odds from multiple bookmakers
     - Head-to-head match history queries
     - Date range queries and player statistics
     - 19 comprehensive unit tests

   - ✓ api-football.com client (src/clients/api_football_client.py)
     - Fetch fixtures/matches with status filtering
     - Fetch standings and team statistics
     - Fetch player performance metrics
     - Betting odds from multiple bookmakers
     - Injury/suspension information
     - Head-to-head and date range queries
     - 21 comprehensive unit tests

3. ✓ **Data Pipeline** (src/scraper/pipeline.py)
   - Orchestrate data collection from all sources (FBref, football-data, api-football)
   - Transform scraped/API data to ORM models
   - Bulk insert/update into database with deduplication
   - Handle data conflicts from multiple sources
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - 18 pipeline unit tests

4. ✓ **Testing** - 94 TOTAL PASSING TESTS
   - Unit tests for each scraper/client with mocking
   - Mock external API responses to avoid real requests
   - Test data transformation pipeline
   - Test database inserts/updates with fixtures
   - Rate limiting and error handling tests
   - All 94 tests passing in 3.01 seconds

5. ✓ **Environment Configuration** (.env.template)
   - API keys for football-data.org and api-football.com
   - FBref scraper configuration (delays, timeouts)
   - Rate limiting parameters for each source
   - Data pipeline feature flags
   - Retry and error handling configuration
   - Logging configuration with optional file output

NEXT STEPS - Phase 3: API Endpoints & Backend

1. **FastAPI/Flask Backend Setup**
   - Create main application entry point (src/api/main.py)
   - Set up dependency injection for database sessions
   - Configure logging and error handling middleware

2. **API Endpoints** (src/api/routes/)
   - GET /api/matches - Fetch matches for league/period
   - GET /api/match/{id}/details - Get advanced metrics for a match
   - POST /api/match/{id}/predict - Generate ML prediction
   - POST /api/prediction/{id}/save - Save prediction to database
   - GET /api/match/{id}/odds - Fetch betting odds
   - GET /api/history - Retrieve all saved predictions & performance

3. **ML Model Training Pipeline** (src/ml/)
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model training script (Logistic Regression baseline)
   - Model evaluation and serialization
   - Prediction generation endpoint integration

4. **Database Integration**
   - Integrate data pipeline with database layer
   - Create management commands for data refresh
   - Set up database migrations (Alembic)

THEN - Phase 4: Frontend & Web Interface
   - League and match selection UI
   - Prediction display and saving
   - Historical predictions and accuracy dashboard
   - Tailwind CSS styling
