COMPLETED
✓ Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Infrastructure
✓ Phase 2: Database Schema Design & SQLAlchemy ORM (10 entities, 14 passing tests)

NEXT STEPS - Phase 2 (Continuation): Web Scraper Implementation

1. **fbref.com Scraper** (src/scraper/fbref_scraper.py)
   - Extract league standings and team statistics
   - Extract historical match data with detailed stats
   - Extract player statistics (optional for future phases)
   - Error handling for missing data and rate limiting
   - Data transformation to match database schema

2. **External API Clients** (src/clients/)
   - football-data.org client (src/clients/football_data_client.py)
     - Fetch current matches for a league
     - Fetch standings
     - Fetch betting odds from multiple bookmakers
   - api-football.com client (src/clients/api_football_client.py)
     - Fetch match details and statistics
     - Fetch player performance metrics
     - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Data Pipeline** (src/scraper/pipeline.py)
   - Orchestrate data collection from all sources
   - Transform scraped data to ORM models
   - Bulk insert into database
   - Update existing records without duplicates
   - Logging and error handling

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each scraper/client
   - Mock external API responses
   - Test data transformation pipeline
   - Test database inserts and updates

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Add API keys to .env.template for external services
   - Configure rate limiting and retry policies
   - Set up logging configuration

THEN - Phase 3: API Endpoints & Backend
   - FastAPI endpoints for match selection, prediction, and history
   - ML model training pipeline
   - Prediction generation endpoint
   - User authentication and prediction storage

THEN - Phase 4: Frontend & Web Interface
   - League and match selection UI
   - Prediction display and saving
   - Historical predictions and accuracy dashboard
   - Tailwind CSS styling
