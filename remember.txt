- All 171 tests passing (19 Phase 3.5 ML tests + 152 existing)
- ML model fully operational with:
  - Feature engineering for match prediction (27 features)
  - Logistic regression and random forest model support
  - Model training, evaluation, serialization
  - Baseline model trained and saved (match_predictor)
  - ML prediction endpoints (POST /api/ml/predict/match/{id}, etc.)
  - Model metrics tracking in database
- FastAPI backend now includes ML prediction capabilities:
  - Health checks and info endpoints
  - League/Team/Match retrieval endpoints
  - Predictions management endpoints
  - Odds retrieval and comparison endpoints
  - ML prediction endpoints with confidence scores
  - Proper error handling and database session management
- CLAUDE.md and remember.txt updated with Phase 3.5 details
- All changes committed with meaningful commit messages

WHAT WAS JUST COMPLETED IN PHASE 3.5:
1. Created src/ml/features.py with comprehensive feature engineering
   - 27 features per match: team stats, H2H analysis, relative metrics
   - Functions for extracting recent matches, calculating team stats, H2H analysis
   - Full training dataset creation from historical matches

2. Created src/ml/model.py with ModelManager for training/prediction
   - Support for logistic regression and random forest models
   - Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, cross-validation)
   - Model serialization with joblib
   - Database storage of model metrics

3. Created src/api/routes/ml.py with three ML prediction endpoints
   - POST /api/ml/predict/match/{id} - Get prediction for a match
   - GET /api/ml/model/metrics - Retrieve model performance metrics
   - POST /api/ml/model/train - Trigger model retraining

4. Added PredictionResult schema to src/api/schemas.py
   - match_id, predicted_outcome, confidence, probabilities

5. Integrated ML router into main FastAPI application (src/api/main.py)

6. Created 19 comprehensive ML unit tests (all passing)
   - Feature engineering tests (7)
   - Dataset creation tests (4)
   - Model manager tests (5)
   - ML integration tests (3)

7. Trained baseline logistic regression model
   - 50 historical matches as training data
   - Accuracy: 100% (test set), 77.5% (cross-validation)
   - All evaluation metrics: 100%

8. Generated model files:
   - /models/match_predictor.joblib
   - /models/match_predictor_encoder.joblib
   - /models/match_predictor_metadata.json

9. Added seed_sample_data() to src/db/init_db.py
   - Creates test leagues, teams, and 50 historical matches

10. Created src/ml/train_baseline.py for automated training
    - Database initialization
    - Sample data seeding
    - Model training and serialization

11. Verified all 171 tests passing (19 new + 152 existing)
